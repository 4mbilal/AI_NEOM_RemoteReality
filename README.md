# VR_RemoteReality
Let's a person "remotely visit" a place using VR goggles. The host uses the headtracking signals to move a servo-mounted stereo camera accordingly. The CNN-SVM detector detects the custom objects in view and plays a picture-in-picture informative video.  
1- Streams stereo video to Android-based VR goggles and receives headtracking signals to actuate the servos.  
2- Detects custom objects using Squeezenet-SVM detector. See Matlab script.  
3- Tested on both Raspbery Pi and Jetson Nano. Raspberry struggles while Jetson comfortably works at >10fps.

# Steps to Compile  
1. Generate CUDA code and executable elf for NVIDIA Jetson Nano using the Matlab Script "ProgramDevice.m" in "JetsonNano" folder. Edit the IP address for specific device to be programmed. This code requires Matlab toolboxes for CNN and support packages for NVIDIA devices.  
2. Generate Android apk using the Android Studio project in the folder "RemoteRealityGogglesAndroid".  
3. Arduino Nano code is in the folder "ArduinoNano". Use Arduino IDE to program the device.  

## *Acknowledgements*:  

1- MJPEG streamer code in its entirety belongs to JPery (github/JPery/MJPEGWriter). Minor changes in code have been made to wait for the next frame to be captured by the camera before streaming. The original code encodes/streams the old frame if newer version is not available. This leads to a false higher fps at the receiving side.
